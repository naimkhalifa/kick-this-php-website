## Simple boilerplate for small php projects

I built this for very simple php projects. It uses [AltoRouter](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/AltoRouter) and [Blade](https://github.com/jenssegers/blade) templating engine (extracted from Laravel).

It lacks a Model and Controller system but I'll probably add if it's needed in some future point.


### Note

The domain root must target the 'www' folder.
To easily boot up a php server go to the 'www' folder and run php -S localhost:8888, for example.
